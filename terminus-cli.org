#+TITLE: Python CLI tool for TerminusDB
#+AUTHOR: Gabriel X. S. Smith
#+LATEX_HEADER:\usepackage{minted}
* Abstract 
  This is a non-interactive python cli tool that helps with the
  interface with terminalDB, It is currently being developed with
  testing being done on the Terminus docker image. This project also
  will attempt to impliment functional programming programming styles

* TODO Glossary
  View the official terminusdb website for terms and definitions
* Backend
  The main library that that is used is the TerminusDB python client
  provided at
  https://terminusdb.github.io/terminusdb-client-python/modules.html
  by the terminusDB developers.

   The best course of action most likely is to do the argument
   handling later since I don't know how difficult that will be. I
   will define an interface so that I can develop other parts of the
   system first.
** [2020-07-02 Thu 18:42]
   To think of this project in chains is the best idea. Individually
   developing each action's command line data structure and then
   calling the associated function(s) to allow for easy extendability.
   
   In this project each action that the user wishes to take with the
   database is seen as a chain of instructions (individual functions
   written specifically for that action) which have little-to-no
   dependancy on code written within another chain. There are no
   handler classes/objects. If code is written that is to apply for
   more than one chain, it is to be applicable to all chains as well
   and therefore must be generalized and well defined in behavior.

*** Specifcs of this project
    As for the specifics of this project. The abstract chains start at
    user command-line input and end at the database library. It is
    quite the simple, a translation layer that make more friendly
    commands from the user to the terminusDB database at the command
    line interface. Due to the translation nature of this software
    there is heavy focus on argument parsing and the attempts to make
    it as compact and simple as possible while still allowing for large
    variety in the possible commands issued.  This is why the first
    part in the chain is modal parsing methods.

    The modal/action parsing methods are given the list of arguments
    that the sys module provides after determining which action/mode
    the user wishes to execute. These methods will construct from the
    command line arguments data structures of optional and positional
    arguments to then send to functions that will call into the
    TerminusDB client library.

    Due to the nature of some of the library calls it is benefital to
    us to individually impliment each feature separate from each other
    since certain actions may have to parse arguments differently
    compared to other actions. This also allows for us to easily
    impliment new features and align with the functional programming
    paradigm with the least risk of breaking a foundational part. I
    also just really don't feel like it is possible to generalize these
    parsing functions without obscene complexity and I don't want to do
    it. Maybe at a later date I will make general these parsing
    functions.
** [2020-07-06 Mon 14:39]
   We will impliment each action and sub action (in it's entirety) in
   a function for the sake of easy maintaininence. I may make a
   dedicated parsing function in the future but at the moment is not
   needed.
** [2020-07-07 Tue 23:26]
   - Have to strighten out how I am going to describe modal parsing
     within text.
** [2020-07-30 Thu 10:13]
   - Heavily considering a migrate to full functional programming for
     the sake of consistency and because of new knowledge of the
     paradigm. Instead of omitting recursion. Need to figure out how
     to do that in python however.
** [2020-08-01 Sat 15:48]
   - Will want to add functionality that extends upon base client
     cababilities. Performing specific operations that help with
     something like the "abstract filesystem," or other ways a user may
     want to use their database.

   - Will want to have the ability for the users to define their own
     subcommands at one point via configuration file possible. This is
     more a long term goal than anything as at the moment I have yet to
     impliment basic functionality, let alone query capabilities.

   - argparse sub parsers don't fit well with document layout and
     functional programming standards. This is a race condition that I
     have found myself in somewhat.

   - We will try to keep each action seperated within its own section in
     the org file.
** [2020-08-06 Thu 12:12]
   Now that the add-database functionality is within it's first
   implimentation, I'm going to impliment the delete database
   functionality.
** [2020-08-06 Thu 13:48]
   Within the planned config file, we should allow for the user to
   provide defaults for commands so as to make command line usage even
   easier and shorter.

* Research
  This section is simply a section that allows for free flowing
  thought and notetaking when regarding something about inteeracting
  with TerminusDB. None of this should be taken as fact, as this is
  where thoughts mature and are nutrued into full fledge ideas and
  knowledge.

** General
   An example of how to use the TerminusDB use is found [[https://terminusdb.com/docs/getting-started/start-tutorials/console_js/#create-a-schema][here]]
** Schemas
   - TerminusDB allows for schemaless databases but heavily encourages
     use of schemas.
     - OWL is used for defining schemas
     - There are javascript and python libraries for schema
       development
   - Schemas define the "Classes" of data which follow closely to how
     classes are described in OOP.
     - Properties are a little confusing.
   - Detailed info on schemas can be found [[https://terminusdb.com/docs/user-guide/schema][here]] and in section
     "Classes ​& Properties" [[https://terminusdb.com/docs/getting-started/intro-graph/][here]]
** Data Mutation
   Data mutation and definition is done completely via WOQL queries.
** Library Models
   The database client is an object which has many methods.
** Listing Databases
   From [[https://terminusdb.github.io/terminusdb-client-python/woqlLib.html][this]] it seems like to edit many of the aspects of a database
   within a TerminusDB instance you must instanciate A WOQLLib object
   which. However I would assume that you must somehow have this
   WOQLLib instance be assocaited to some client connection or
   returned from it. This WOQLLib object seems to mainly be a data
   struture with simple getters and setters. Possibly an intermediary
   structure sent between the python code and the terminusdb_client
   api calls.o
* Command-Line Parser
  This is where nearly all program flow is determined. There must be a
  translation interface in place to convert comanndline arguments into
  usable structures within python. That is done here.
** Actions/Mode Interface

   This interface is the interface that is used to translate the
   command line arguements into something usable. It will be seperated
   into multiple modes determined by actions. Much like the program
   Heimdall or git.

    - Argparse to handle parsing

       We could actually just have the main hook contain our parser code,
       even though it would be tangled into the main function within literate
       programming it would still reside in the appropriate 'add-database'
       section.
     - Note taken on [2020-08-01 Sat 00:58] \\
       Having the argument parser used in the main func would be useless as
       you would have to make your own copy of it when you could just
       instanciate a new one and avoid odd inter-function dependancies
     :END:
     This action/mode starts off by being called by the main function
     when the user launches the program specifying the [[id:e8a096ce-4c07-4a69-97ec-d2cbd35b965c][add-database]]
     action on the command-line (ref, [[id:92629282-f4d0-490d-8b03-5b00da4b97d6][Main hook]]). 

     Once called, this action calls a helper function which parses and
     aggregates the command line argument options, returning a hashmap
     with the appropriate kwargs to accomplish the add-database
     action.

     With this hashmap the add-database action passes it into a
     separate helper function which calls into the TerminusDB python
     client, interacting with the TerminusDB instance and creating the
     desired database.
